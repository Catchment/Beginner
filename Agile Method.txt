AGILE Methodology: 
-> In short, adopting to situations through Iterative approach.
			          (step by step process)
-> Req, plans and results are evaluated continuously so teams
have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

Agile Manifesto:

* Individual and Interactions over process and tools
* Working Software over comprehensive doc
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

eg) That is, while there is value in the items on the right,
	     we value the items on the left more.

Frameworks in Agile:
1)Scrum Framework
2)KANBAN
3)eXtreme Programming
4)Scaled Agile Frmk(SAFe)

Scrum Frmk:
->frmk for develping and sustaining complex products
->describes a set of meetings, tools and roles that work in concert
to help teams structure and manage their work.

Scrum Roles:			Scrum ceremonies:
*Developers(Team)		* Sprint Plan meeting
*Product owner			* Daily Standupcall
*Scrum Master			* Sprint review
				* Sprint Retrospective

1) a person(Customer) who have idea of developing a software but dont have 
knowledge to develop approaches a S/w company to develop it.

2) he/she meets up with person who have common interest(vision) and 
accepts to develop the software after certain months, 
who later will called as *"Product Owner"*

3) Product Owner takes the Requirements and create a Document called 
   "LOG". Note: after the sprints starts it is called backglog. 
    When this log is present with Product owner it is called 
    "Product backglog."

4) Product owner forms a Team(developers, testers, etc) and create a 
"Sprint plan". The requirements for the sprint plan is discussed in
"Sprint plan Meeting". usually one sprint will always be 2-4weeks, mostly
2 weeks.

5)Each sprint(2 weeks) requiremetns (tasks) will be logged as 
"Spring Backlog".

6) While the sprint process is going on, every day All Team members should
attend a meeting called "Standup meeting" or "Scrum call" for the 
entire sprint. all have to inform their work status like
			-> what i did yesterday?
			-> What am i doing today?
			-> is there any blocker for my work today?	

7) This standup meeting will be conducted by "Scrum master"(like a coach).
Scrum master don't need to be a technical expert but knows well about the 
Agile - Scrum principles and advice every team member to follow them strictly.

8) After 2 weeks(usuall sprint), a potentially shippable product will be
obtained. The product which can be used individually to run it is 
the shippable product. This is should be the end result of every Sprint

9)"Sprint review Meeting" - review meeting is done on the shippable product
			    as per customer requirement.to inspect the outcome
			    of sprint. Like, done or not done?

10)Increment - A sum of usable sprint backlog items completed by the Developers
	       in the sprint that meets the definition of done, plus the value
	       of all the increments that came before.

11)"Sprint retrospective meeting" - review meeting is done to the Whole
				     team whether they did work as needed.
				     How better they can be done, like using
				     diff techs?

12) If the requirements from "sprint backlog" are not met within the particular 
sprint, the timeline for that particular sprint should not be extended as 
it will break scrum rules.

13)this sprint backlog will then be added to Product Backlog and then moved to 
spring backlog before the starting another sprint.  



Scrum Roles and Responsibilites:

1)Product owner:
->provides the vision of the product to the team
->maintains the product backlog
->prioritize the backlog items to achieve the best
->explaining the backlog in a clear manner to the
team to help the team to make better decisions.

2)Team:
-> taking the task from product backlog and make a potentail shippable item
-> self organised (what to commit and how to commit) decided by the team not
by the product owner.
->cross functional(analysis, dev, test, DB) and Structured team.
even if some team members are absent like, dev and DB remaining members
should compensate for their work(even they should perform the role of dev and DB)
because the sprint is just a 2 week process.
-> team is accountable as a whole( no blame game)
-> usually 7 to 10 persons

3)Scrum Master : (Agile, scrum coach)
->helps team to adopt scrum
->helps team how to be self organised
->protects the team from outside interference
->conducts scrum events
->eliminates obstrcution for the progress of the team
->Scrum Master is not and should not be the product owner/Manager


Scrum ceremonies (Events);

1)Sprint Planning - ~2hrs - Team, Scrum Master, Product owner
 		  - occurs before the start of the sprint
purpose:
->discuss each item on the backlog and prioritize the backlog and the entire
team collectively estimates the effort involved.
->dev team will make a forecast on how much work can be done on that 
sprint considering several factors and risks.
->the shortlisted list of backglog becomes sprint backlog

2)Daily Standup - ~15min - Team, Scrum Master, Product owner - occurs daily
		- conducted by scrum master

Note: 	presence of product owner is high in productbased comp.
	and very less in service based.
	Even Scrum master might not be a dedicated person for standup call
	someone like TL will act as scrum master
	
-> to quickly inform everyone(team) on whats going on across the team.
-> it is not a detailed one. It should be short and to the point
-> the following questions are answered by the team
		1)what did i complete yesterday?
		2)what will i work on today?
		3) am i blocked by anything?

3)Sprint review / Iteration review - ~30min-1hr - Team, SM, PO
				   - at the end of each sprint about the product

->review about, how good the end product delivered by the team is, and its feedback
->the team will showcase(demo) the work they did
->this event is to celebrate the completion of iteration and get feedback
->happens on friday and is more like a fun meeting rather than formal

4)Sprint Retrospective Meeting - ~1hr - Team, SM, PO
			       - at the end of each sprint about the team
->help the team understand "want went well" & "what didnt" for the team.
->rather complaining, team will keep doing things which are under
"what went well" category and will try to find creative solutions for things
that didnt go well.
->continuously getting adopted and learning is the CORE ESSENCE of Agile and 
retrospective is the KEY place for that
